## 📄 Key Files

### `products.md` — Your Catalog

This is what your agent knows how to sell.

```markdown
## Product Name

- **Price:** $XX.XX
- **Stock:** X available
- **Materials:** What it's made of
- **Shipping:** 3-5 business days
- **Description:** Why customers love it

Tags: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific — include what customers ask about
- Keep prices accurate
- Update stock when things sell
- Add good tags for matching

### `CLAUDE.md` — Agent Brain

Instructions for how your agent behaves:
- What it knows about your shop
- How to handle questions
- What NOT to do

Customize for your shop's needs.

### `SOUL.md` — Agent Personality

Your agent's voice:
- Friendly or professional?
- Casual or formal?
- Playful or serious?

**Match your brand.** Your agent should sound like you.

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Customer: "Do you have any necklaces under $50?"
        ↓
Agent reads products.md
        ↓
Finds matching items
        ↓

```

All local. All instant. No external calls except the AI.
