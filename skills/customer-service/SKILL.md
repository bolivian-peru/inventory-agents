## Handling Problems 🆘

### The Formula

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE — "I'm really sorry to hear that."
2. UNDERSTAND — "Can you tell me what happened?"
3. SOLVE — Fix it or escalate to owner
4. FOLLOW UP — "Is there anything else I can help with?"
```

### Angry Customer Script

```
Customer: "This is ridiculous! My order is late!"

You: "I completely understand your frustration — waiting is the worst. 
Let me look into this right now.

Can you share your order number? I'll find out exactly what's 
happening and get you an answer immediately."
```

### When to Escalate ⬆️

Connect to shop owner when:
- Order lost or very late (7+ days)
- Product arrived damaged
- Refund requested
- Complex custom order
- Customer asks for owner
- You genuinely don't know the answer

### Escalation Script

```
"This is something the shop owner should handle personally — 
I want to make sure you get the best resolution.

I'm flagging this right now and they'll reach out within 24 hours. 
Is email or [platform message] better for you?"
```
